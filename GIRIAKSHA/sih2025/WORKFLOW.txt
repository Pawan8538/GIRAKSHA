This is the final practical workflow you actually need for development.

🌟 0. Inputs Can Be Three Types

Your system accepts any of these, depending on availability:

A. Real Sensors → Automatic Input

(optional, some sites may not have sensors)

B. Manual Uploaded Data → Excel / CSV / Values

(for sites where sensors don’t exist)

C. Visual Evidence → Image/Video from workers

(complaints, cracks, emergency photos)

Your ML model should be able to work with whichever inputs are available.

⭐ 1. Data Comes In (3 Possible Ways)
1A. Sensor Data (if available)

Sensor sends data → backend receives it

Backend stores it → sends to ML model

If no sensors → skip this part.

1B. Manual Data Upload (Important for your requirement)

Site admin manually uploads:

Excel

CSV

JSON

Manual values (typed in UI)

The backend converts this into a feature vector and sends it to ML model.

1C. Worker Complaint Data

Worker uploads:

Photos

Videos

Description

Location

Backend sends:

Image/video → image model

Notes → text-based features (optional)

⭐ 2. Backend Sends Data to ML Model

Regardless of source (sensor/manual/complaint):

Backend prepares data →
Backend calls:

POST http://ml-service/predict


Sending:

values

metadata

image/video if needed

ML service responds with:

risk score

risk level (low/medium/high)

explanation

forecast (if supported)

⭐ 3. Backend Receives ML Output

Backend now has predictions.
It stores them and triggers events.

⭐ 4. Backend Decides What To Do

Based on ML model output, backend:

If Risk = HIGH or CRITICAL

create alert

notify workers

notify site admin

notify govt authorities

attach image if any

If Risk = LOW / MEDIUM

store record

show on dashboard

update map

⭐ 5. Frontend Shows Results
Web Dashboard (Site Admin + Super Admin)

They see:

risk predictions

map with color zone

list of alerts

complaints

manual uploads

AI explanations

Mobile App (Field Worker & Govt)

They see:

alerts

map view (simple)

messages

assigned tasks

ability to upload complaint

SOS button

⭐ 6. Government Authorities Interaction

Authorities get:

alerts forwarded by site admin

snapshots/images

simple map

message window
They can:

acknowledge

send instructions

⭐ 7. Super Admin

Handles:

sensors (if any)

user roles

gov authorities

locations

model version

settings

👉 Putting It All Together (ULTRA SIMPLE STORY)**

Data arrives
From sensors / manual uploads / worker complaints.

Backend prepares it
Converts into ML-ready format.

Backend sends to ML model
Model already created.

Model returns risk & explanation

Backend logs it

Backend triggers alerts
To workers, admins, govt.

Frontends show results
Map + alerts + complaints.

And that’s literally the entire workflow.
